In this program, we created a list of 5 favouraite fruits and assigned
it to a variable word_list. We then printed the entire list to the screen.

We then selected a random fruit from the list, and asked user to input a 
character. We validated the user input by checking if what the user entered
was trully a single character, otherwise a user is asked to try again.


THI IS AN UPDATE
